This is an ongoing port of the [KaTeX JS library](https://github.com/khan/KaTeX/) to Python.
It's only really intended for personal use at the moment,
so that [Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) can render math directly.

This project does not currently work;
I'm gradually working thru the JS files and translating them to Python.
I'll update this README when it's finished. ^_^
